Source code and datasets for KSEM 2020 paper "An Embedding-based Framework for Detecting Similar Mobile Applications"

Introduction：
In this paper, we presented a novel framework by knowledge graph and embedding techniques, which is suitable for cybersecurity analysts to find similar apps. We further designed a light-weight ontology for the construction of knowledge graph, which can present more comprehensive information of apps to analysts and generate more shared linkages among apps. To obtain accurate representations of new apps, we employed TextRank algorithm to enhance the structured information and optimized the concatenation strategy for network embedding models.
The preliminary result indicated the effectiveness of our framework comparing to several existing methods in terms of reciprocal ranking average and minimum ranking. 

Code Usage:
The model in our experiment are in the following scripts:
src/model.py
src/net2vec.py
To train these model, please run:
src/train.py
To evalute the effective of our model, please run following scripts:
src/rr.py
src/rankmin.py
src/rarnk_cal.py

Dependencies:
Python (>=3.6)
pytorch (>=1.1.0)
Numpy
sklearn

Training:
The training parameters are same in the two datasets.

batchsize:1024
learning rate:0.01
embedding size:128
negative rate:5
negative sampling:”unif”
optimize method:”Adam”


Data sets:  
MAKG-E is a benchmark dataset that select some apps with Chinese and English in mobile applications knowledge graph. For each app in the test set, we invite several experienced analysts to select 20 most similar apps as a standard set from the candidate apps generated by TF-IDF algorithm based on their textual descriptions.
MAKG-E-Plus is an enhanced one that has integrated important tokens and corresponding relationships of apps based on TextRank algorithm, in which the threshold $\theta$ for selecting important tokens is set to 0.5.
